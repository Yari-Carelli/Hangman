"""
In this separate python file I have created the 7 visual stages of hangman;
this includes the initial empty state, as well as the other stages, and I
have stored them in a list outside the display_hangman function.
Each stage corresponds to a number of tries the player has left.
I will be using this to display the current stage of hangman at each turn in
the command prompt.
